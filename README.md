## This function fetches weather and cryptocurrency data asynchronously and updates the DOM accordingly, providing real-time information to the user. And it is styled for all screen sizes

1. The function begins with a try block to handle potential errors during asynchronous operations.

2. It uses the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() method to obtain the user's current position asynchronously. This is wrapped in a Promise to ensure the asynchronous result is handled properly.

3. After obtaining the user's position, the function sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API (https://apis.scrimba.com/openweathermap/data/2.5/weather) to fetch weather data based on the latitude and longitude coordinates.

4. If the weather data retrieval is successful (i.e., weatherRes.ok is true), it parses the JSON response and extracts relevant information such as temperature, city name, and weather icon URL. Then, it updates the DOM elements related to weather with the fetched data.

5. Next, the function sends a request to the CoinGecko API (https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/dogecoin) to fetch cryptocurrency data for Dogecoin.

6. If the cryptocurrency data retrieval is successful, it parses the JSON response and updates the DOM elements related to cryptocurrency with the fetched data, including the cryptocurrency's name, logo, current price, highest price in the last 24 hours, and lowest price in the last 24 hours.

7. Any errors that occur during the process are caught in the catch block, and appropriate error handling can be implemented.
